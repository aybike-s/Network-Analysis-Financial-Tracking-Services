# Methodology overview

International humanitarian aid is a contested discourse and difficult area to analyze mainly due to the data limitations, unclear motives from the donors’ side, and inconsistencies in reporting. However, it provides important insights into state relations and dependency. The main motive behind this research is to use the available data in international humanitarian aid to observe how humanitarian aid transactions establish networks with different topologies and investigate their robustness. In the light of this motive, the following research question was established:

•	How to conceptualize and operationalize the robustness of the international humanitarian aid networks? 

The data for analyses is gathered from Financial Tracking Services (FTS) (UNOCHA). First, the dataset was partitioned according to the years between 2024 and 1999. Then, bipartite networks and Sankey diagrams are established according to each year. Finally, the local clustering coefficient, degree distribution & edge weights, and PageRank were analyzed to evaluate network robustness for the aggregation of the networks (by combining each year) that constitute the system of the international humanitarian aid network.
